# Eurofighter EFM for the DCS Eurofighter Community Mod
An enchanced flight model for the mod originaly derived from a VSN EFM and modified to suit the Eurofighter and the requirements for it.

## So what is this?

This is a C++ Project created for the DCS Eurofighter community mod. This was my first C++ project and was quite a sharp starting point, however with much work its finaly in a good state. This was created as part of the mods 'Refurbishment' so to speak to solve many problems the Default SFM creates as well as to generaly provide a more realistic platform with better logic for players to use.

## Who made this?

I will not take credit for what i did not make, A lot of the base files are from the VSN Efm however many modified for new functions or more depth, If something was not made by me it will have the following credits in the file however components such as the FCS was done by me as well as many bug fixes from the original.

## Any questions?

Please message me on Discord (@Degeneratefoxxo) If you have any questions/need help with anything.

Thanks for reading!
